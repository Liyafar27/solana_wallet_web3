## 🔒 Security & Privacy

This app is 100% self-custodial:
- The mnemonic phrase and private keys are generated and stored **only in memory**.
- Nothing sensitive is sent over the network.
- Users are responsible for backing up their wallet securely.
- All transactions are signed locally.

We never store or transmit private keys or mnemonics.
